Our program works by launching two different files. One is ChatClient.java
And the other is ChatServer.java. Launch chatServer.java and start listening.
Then to launch different clients launch ChatClient.java. To start a connection
Press connect and enter the IP and port info provided by the server. Enter a
unique name and prime numbers. If prime numbers below 16411 or not prime numbers
are entered the program will generate two random prime integers. You can then send a message
to users once you are connected by selecting the existing clients from the side panel and
clicking send.
Some issues: If you run into a glitch where our client list doesn't immediately update,
it will work if you launch another client and connect to update the previous client.
This program was compiled and ran through IntelliJ and should run successfully through command line.
The file prime.txt contains 23 different prime integers, and the current block size is 4 but
it can easily be changed to blocking size of 2 and still work.
Happy Grading!
